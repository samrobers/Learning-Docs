#How Is Crypto Mined?

Crypto Currency is popular due to the fact that it runs on a decentralized network. 

This means that instead of normal transactions that are made between banks, to send friends money, or to make regular transactions, you do not have to go through a centralized bank such as wells fargo and they do not have a hand in what you do. This leads to the question of, well how do I have a record of my transaction ? 

All transactions made with crypto are written and stored in the block chain. It is records of transactions that have been verified and then stored inside a block, chained onto the blockchain.

How are these verified? 


Written into the bloxkchain is a cryptographic hash puzzle to add the transactions, once it is solved you can dip into the memory pool, put transaction into the hash pool. 

This is where miners come in, when transactions are made, they are put into a sort of waiting room to be added to the blockchain, this waiting room for the transactions has a hash puzzle that must be solved which will verify the transaction. The miners that verify the transaction will then add the transactions to the blockchain creating and storing that record.
